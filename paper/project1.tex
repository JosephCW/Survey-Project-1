	\begin{abstract}
		Calculating the maximum sum of values within a contiguous subset of an array is a problem mostly found in the field of image processing.
		This paper explores the impact of using two different approaches to solve this problem.One approach is using a brute force algorithm, and the other is using a more optimized approach known as Kadane's algorithm.
		Due to the different complexity of these two algorithms used to solve it,
		we will see the performance impact over a range of different sized arrays.
	\end{abstract}
	\section{Background and Related Work}
  Finding the largest subarray is a problem where we have to find an subarray within a given list $L$. And make sure that the found subarray has a sum higher than any other possible subarrays within $L$.
  This algorithm is important and has some real world uses. One such as computer vision, to find the brightest area within an image, it's basically a ``Maximum Subarray'' problem on the lumens within the list of pixels.

	\subsection{Brute Force Algorithm}

	\begin{algorithm}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\caption{Brute Force}\label{bruteforce}
	\Function{bruteForce}{A}
	\State $n\gets len(A)$
	\State $maxsum\gets A[0]$
	\For{$i$ in 0..$n$-1}
	\For{$j$ in $i$..$n$-1}
	\State $total\gets 0$
	\For{$k$ in $i$..$j$}
	\State $total\gets total + A[k]$
	\EndFor
	\If{$maxsum < total$}
	\State $maxsum\gets total$
	\EndIf
	\EndFor
	\EndFor
	\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}


	This brute force algorithm works by keeping track of both a start and ending index, and then calculating a sum for all the indexes between.
	% Summation Equation
	\[\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}\sum_{j = i}^{n-1}\sum_{k = i}^{j}1\]

	The starting index goes from the position of the first element until the last element, while the ending index repeats for all values between the starting index and the position of the last element.
	A third loop then sums all the values found between these two indexes.

	The outer loop keeps track of $i$, the starting index, and runs the entire length of the array, or $n$ times.
	The middle loop keeps track $j$, the ending index, and runs the length between $i$ and the end of the array, $n$.
	There is then another inner value, $k$, which runs between the values of $i$ and $j$.

	Due to these three nested summations, the brute force algorithm runs in $O(n^3)$ time.
	It should be noted, however, that there is a slightly different version of this brute force algorithm that runs in $O(n^2)$ time by doing the sum as part of the second loop.

	\subsection{Kadane Algorithm}

  \begin{algorithm}
		\caption{Kadane Algorithm}\label{kadane}
	\begin{algorithmic}
	  \Function{Kadane}{L}
    \State $maxEnding \gets L[0]$
    \State $maxAlways \gets L[0]$
    \For{i 1..len(L)}
    \State $maxEnding \gets \Call{max}{L[i], maxEnding + L[i]}$
    \State $maxAlways \gets \Call{max}{maxAlways, maxEnding}$
    \EndFor
	  \Return{$maxAlways$}
	  \EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
  Kadane is a very good example of a simple but effective way to write a better algorithm using dynamic programming. It focuses on remembering two very important variables $maxEnding$ and $maxAlways$. $maxAlways$ will always remember the largest sum you've seen up till now out of all the subarrays. But $maxEnding$ will keep track of the largest subset just within that iteration of i. Because it remembers what sort of sums you've checked before, you do not have to check other possible subarrays again. Thus getting rid of the 2 for loops within the brute force algorithm.

  \[
  \sum_1^n2 \\
  = 2 * n \\
  = \Theta(n)
		\]
	This algorithm is $\Theta(n)$ because it only goes through each element of the array once and only once.
	\section{Experimental Setup}
	For the experimental setup, we have allowed our users to either input an array to test both algorithms against, or run our own tests.
  Our own tests included of multiple n values that will be timed. For each n value, we randomly generate n numbers of numbers between -5 and 5 inclusive and place them into a list. We then will time each run of the Brute Force algorithm and Kadane algorithm to go through that list of random numbers. After about 100 trials for each n, we will collecte all the timing data and proceed to find the averge run time for both algorithms for that n.
  Timing data is collected by using a high definition clock within Rust. These timings were done on an Intel Xenon X5570 processor clocked at 2.9GHz. The host machine was running a 64bit version of Fedora 29 Server Edition.

	\section{Conclusions}
	As cleary shown through our graph and time table found in Section 3,
	Kadane's algorithm is a much more optimized solution to solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of values within an array.
	A brute forcing algorithm can be simplified down to $O(n^2)$, but our algorithm runs in $O(n^3)$.
	At the same time Kadane's algorithm runs in $O(n)$ time meaning that it will execute much faster.
	The amount of time that this algorithm saves is exponential.
